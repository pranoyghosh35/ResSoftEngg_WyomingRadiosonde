# ResSoftEngg_WyomingRadiosonde
Softwares created during research projects often lack visibility - here is a Jupyter notebook with python codes which I used to download and format large amount of radiosonde data from Wyoming upper air sounding website for my undergraduate research project-
"Study of Atmospheric Refractive Index Structure Constant using Radiosonde Measurements". This work has been presented at two IEEE technically cosponsored events including https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8882953.  
Radiosonde / Upperair sounding of all stations from 1973-present day (as available) across globe has been archived at Wyoming Upper Sounding website https://weather.uwyo.edu/upperair/sounding.html. 
Downloading this data manually for multiple stations and/or years and/or months and/or days and/or hours and removing unnecessary rows or seperating radiosonde data from station/sounding metadata saving to different files are a very labour and time consuming task . So these codes were developed in which the required data can be bulk downloaded, cleaned,saved into text files and grouped in folders for months or seasons etc. The researchers then only need to read the data from plain text file into numpy array/pandas data frame (assuming python users!) and use it to calculate other parameters - for our case various profiles of Atmospheric Refractive Index Structure Constant (Cn2).
